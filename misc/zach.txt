Hey Zach, I hope you don't mind I took a look at your website and your app and noticed a slight difference in rebrand between the two. The app seemed more premium oriented so I went ahead and made a redesign based on the current website's content. Feel free to toss if out if you don't use it but I built everything so it's directly compatible with squarespace.
