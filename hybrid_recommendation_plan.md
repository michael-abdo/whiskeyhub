## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Data Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Create Unified Data Loader**
   - Refactor existing CSV loading from `db_connect.py`
   - Add data validation and cleaning
   - Create train/test splitting logic
   - Cache processed data for faster iteration

2. **Build Feature Engineering Pipeline**
   - Extract user preference profiles from ratings
   - Normalize whiskey features (proof, complexity, etc.)
   - Create interaction features (user_complexity_preference)
   - Handle missing values systematically

### Phase 2: Collaborative Filtering (Week 2)
3. **Implement User-Based Collaborative Filtering**
   - Create user similarity matrix (cosine similarity)
   - Build neighborhood-based predictions
   - Handle cold start problem for new users
   - Optimize with sparse matrix operations

4. **Add Matrix Factorization**
   - Implement SVD for dimensionality reduction
   - Use existing 58% density advantage
   - Tune latent factors (start with 20-50)
   - Add regularization to prevent overfitting

### Phase 3: Content-Based Filtering (Week 1)
5. **Build Content-Based Model**
   - Use proven features: complexity, finish_duration
   - Create whiskey feature vectors
   - Implement similarity calculations
   - Generate recommendations based on whiskey attributes

6. **Create User Preference Profiles**
   - Calculate user's preferred complexity level
   - Track finish duration preferences
   - Build personalized feature weights
   - Update profiles with new ratings

### Phase 4: Hybrid Integration (Week 2)
7. **Develop Hybrid Model**
   - Weighted combination approach (start 60% collaborative, 40% content)
   - Dynamic weight adjustment based on user data availability
   - Fallback strategies for sparse users
   - A/B testing framework for weight optimization

8. **Implement Business Logic**
   - Filter by availability/price constraints
   - Boost recommendations for featured products
   - Diversification to avoid repetitive suggestions
   - Explanation generation ("Because you liked X...")

### Phase 5: API Development (Week 1)
9. **Create FastAPI Service**
   - RESTful endpoints for all recommendation types
   - Async request handling for performance
   - Response caching with Redis
   - Rate limiting and authentication

10. **Build Model Serving Pipeline**
    - Load pre-trained models on startup
    - Hot-reload capability for model updates
    - Batch prediction endpoints
    - Real-time feature computation

### Phase 6: Evaluation & Optimization (Week 1)
11. **Implement Evaluation Suite**
    - Cross-validation framework
    - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, Recall@K
    - A/B testing infrastructure
    - User satisfaction tracking

12. **Performance Optimization**
    - Profile bottlenecks
    - Implement caching strategies
    - Optimize matrix operations
    - Consider approximate algorithms for scale

## Key Technical Decisions

### Algorithm Choices
- **Collaborative**: Start with memory-based, migrate to model-based (SVD) for scale
- **Content**: TF-IDF for text features, normalized euclidean distance for numeric
- **Hybrid**: Linear combination with learned weights

### Technology Stack
- **ML**: scikit-learn, surprise library for collaborative filtering
- **API**: FastAPI for async performance
- **Cache**: Redis for recommendation caching
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production data
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on cloud platform

### Simplification Strategies
1. Start with pre-computed recommendations (batch processing)
2. Use existing linear model features as baseline
3. Implement simple weighted average before complex ensemble
4. Cache aggressively to reduce computation

## Potential Gotchas & Solutions

### Data Challenges
- **Gotcha**: Missing whiskey features (139/191 incomplete)
- **Solution**: Imputation strategy + content-based fallback

### Scale Challenges
- **Gotcha**: Matrix operations slow with more users
- **Solution**: Approximate nearest neighbors, sampling

### Cold Start Problem
- **Gotcha**: New users/whiskeys have no history
- **Solution**: Popularity baseline + onboarding quiz

### Model Drift
- **Gotcha**: Preferences change over time
- **Solution**: Scheduled retraining + online learning

## Success Metrics
- Model: RMSE < 0.5, Precision@10 > 0.3
- Performance: < 100ms recommendation latency
- Business: 20% increase in user engagement

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: Data infrastructure + Content-based
- Week 3-4: Collaborative filtering
- Week 5-6: Hybrid integration + API
- Week 7: Evaluation and optimization
- Week 8: Documentation + deployment prep

This plan prioritizes simplicity while building toward the full hybrid system. Start with content-based (easiest with existing features), add collaborative filtering, then combine for best results.
