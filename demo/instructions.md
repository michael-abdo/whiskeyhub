### Full Job Description
Summary
     Overview:
Whiskey Hub is a premium app designed for whiskey lovers to rate, review, and discover new bottles based on their unique flavor preferences. We‚Äôre looking for a skilled machine learning engineer to build and integrate a smart, flavor-based recommendation system into our mobile app (React Native).

This system will help users discover new whiskeys they‚Äôre likely to love, predict their ratings, and visualize their flavor preferences‚Äîall powered by ML models trained on user tasting data and trusted whiskey metadata.

What You‚Äôll Build:
1. Personalized Whiskey Recommendations
Recommend bottles based on each user‚Äôs tasting history, factoring in:

Whiskey attributes: flavor profiles, flavor intensity, proof, viscosity, complexity, type, price

User‚Äôs past ratings

Broader user trends

2. Rating Prediction
Given any specific whiskey‚Äôs flavor profile, predict how a specific user would rate it, even if they haven‚Äôt tried it yet.

3. Custom Flavor Profile Matching
Users can define a desired flavor profile in two ways:

Use sliders for the 8 major flavor categories (Sweet, Fruity, Floral, Spicy, Raw, Earthy, Dark, Light)

Add specific desired tasting notes (e.g., ‚Äúvanilla,‚Äù ‚Äúclove‚Äù)
Return a ranked list of bottles matching their target profile, with estimated personal ratings.

4. Sensitivity Analysis
Provide data outputs that show which flavor categories or whiskey attributes most strongly correlate with high and low ratings for each user. This will inform user-facing visualizations of their flavor palate (handled by a UI designer).

5. Gift Buying Guide
A feature that allows users to get personalized whiskey recommendations for someone else (another app user), based on that person‚Äôs tasting history and preferences.

What We Have:
A growing database of whiskeys with metadata: proof, type, brand, price, etc.

Initial tasting and rating data from users (limited volume)

"Distiller‚Äôs notes" from trusted sources to supplement early training

A React Native mobile app with an established flavor graph interface

A product roadmap focused on user-centric whiskey exploration

Tech & Tools We Expect You to Use:
Python

Scikit-Learn / XGBoost / LightGBM (for tree-based models)

Collaborative + Content-Based Filtering techniques

SHAP or similar for sensitivity analysis / feature attribution

Data preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy

Deployment-ready architecture for on-demand predictions via API or serverless function (e.g., FastAPI or Flask)

Deliverables
Clean, documented ML code in Python with modular structure that's able to be easily implemented into the existing app code.

All model inputs/outputs tailored for integration into the Whiskey Hub app

Output-ready data to support visualizations (no design work needed)

Recommendations and rating predictions that update based on new user data

Ideal Candidate:
You‚Äôve built recommendation systems or predictive models in production before

You know how to work with both content-based and collab

## üéØ FINAL COMPLETION REQUIREMENT: navigation.yaml Generation

**CRITICAL:** Once ALL development work is 100% complete and the demo is fully functional, you MUST create a `navigation.yaml` file as the completion signal.

### Navigation.yaml Requirements

Generate a comprehensive YAML workflow file for automated testing of your completed demo. This file serves as:
1. **Completion indicator** - Signals that Executive work is finished
2. **Testing blueprint** - Enables automated validation of the demo
3. **User journey map** - Documents the intended user experience

### YAML Structure Required:

```yaml
name: "[Project Name] - Demo Workflow"
description: "Automated testing workflow for [project description]"
version: "1.0.0"

config:
  headless: true
  timeout: 15000
  viewport:
    width: 1280
    height: 720

steps:
  # Navigation and interaction steps here
```

### Step Generation Guidelines:

1. **Start with homepage navigation**: Always begin with navigating to index.html
2. **Test all major features**: Include steps for every interactive element
3. **Verify content**: Add assertions for key text, headings, and functionality
4. **Capture key moments**: Include screenshots at major interaction points
5. **Test user journeys**: Cover primary use cases end-to-end
6. **Include waits**: Add appropriate delays for dynamic content

### Required Step Types to Include:

- `navigate` - To main pages (index.html, other pages)
- `wait-for-selector` - For dynamic content loading
- `click` - For buttons, links, interactive elements
- `type` - For form inputs (if applicable)
- `assertText` - To verify content loaded correctly
- `screenshot` - At key interaction points
- `evaluate` - For JavaScript functionality verification

### Example Step Pattern:

```yaml
steps:
  - type: navigate
    description: "Navigate to demo homepage"
    url: "file://[FULL_PATH]/index.html"
    screenshot: true
    
  - type: wait-for-selector
    description: "Wait for main content to load"
    selector: "main, .main-content, #content"
    
  - type: assertText
    description: "Verify page title loaded"
    selector: "h1"
    expected: "[Expected main heading]"
    
  - type: click
    description: "Test navigation menu"
    selector: ".nav-menu a:first-child"
    screenshot: true
```

### Content Analysis Instructions:

Based on the demo you created:
1. **Map all interactive elements**: Buttons, forms, navigation links
2. **Identify key content**: Headers, important text, success messages
3. **Document user flows**: How users would navigate through the demo
4. **Note dynamic features**: Any JavaScript interactions or state changes
5. **Plan verification points**: What should be tested to prove functionality

### Completion Verification:

The navigation.yaml must include:
- **8-15 meaningful test steps** covering the full demo
- **3+ screenshots** at key interaction points
- **2+ assertions** verifying content/functionality
- **Complete user journey** from landing to key features
- **Realistic selectors** based on your actual HTML structure
- **Appropriate timeouts** for any dynamic content

### Final Instructions:

**DO NOT CREATE navigation.yaml until:**
1. ‚úÖ All HTML files are complete and functional
2. ‚úÖ All CSS styling is polished and professional
3. ‚úÖ All JavaScript interactivity is working
4. ‚úÖ All content is real (no placeholders)
5. ‚úÖ Demo opens properly in browser
6. ‚úÖ All requirements from instructions.md are met

**ONLY THEN** create the navigation.yaml file using the workflow generation guidelines above.

This navigation.yaml file is the FINAL deliverable that signals Executive completion.

### Project-Specific Customizations

Based on the Upwork job requirements above, ensure the demo specifically addresses:
- The core functionality mentioned in the job description
